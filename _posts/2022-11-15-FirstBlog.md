This is my first blog post. This weekend I am going to Palermo, Italy to run a half marathon. I have been training for many weeks, running 10 miles most days so hopefully I can perform well. I will be in the city for a further couple of days so hope to spend some time exploring. The FIFA World Cup also starts this week which should be an exciting tournament.
